## Route Mapping Notes

- All original `/mysite/*` paths have been mapped to clean root-level routes
- The original `patient-portal-at287` has been simplified to `patient-portal`
- The original `contact-us` page contained hours and location info, so it maintains the same route
- All internal navigation links have been updated to point to the new clean routes
- External links (Facebook, phone numbers, etc.) have been preserved exactly as they appeared in the original site

## Navigation Structure

The site maintains the same navigation structure as the original:

All routes are fully functional with complete content migrated from the original site.
